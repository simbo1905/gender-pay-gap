8.Integration
List needed attributes and test Fixtures and Methods:
Setups and Tear down Structuring

Attributes used:
Test attribute
Order attribute
Description attribute

Setups and Tear down attribute:
SetUpAttribute is now used exclusively for per-test setup.
TearDownAttribute is now used exclusively for per-test teardown.
OneTimeSetUpAttribute is used for one-time setup.
OneTimeTearDownAttribute is used for one-time teardown.
SetUpFixtureAttribute continues to be used as at before, but with changed method attributes.

Structure:
Create group and categories:
Then categorize the tests into Folder, Namespace, Files, classes Set up and tear down methods, and test methods as well as appropriate attributes
categorise Red Green refactor in such a way to be able to run all reds and then all greens

logical Structure:
