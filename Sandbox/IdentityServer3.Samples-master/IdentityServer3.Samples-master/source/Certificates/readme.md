# Test certificates #

Here you can find the test certificates that we use in IdentityServer3 samples and core.

**You don't need to install these certificates to run the core host or the samples**

If you want to load certificates from the certificate store, we provide the idsrv3test public/private key pair for testing (including the root certificate). Use the following instructions:

6. Click Next
7. Enter idsrv3test as the password
8. Click Next
9. Click Next (again)
